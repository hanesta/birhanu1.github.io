Integration is a fundamental concept in calculus, which is a branch of mathematics that deals with the study of rates of change and accumulation. Integration is the inverse operation of differentiation, and it is used to find the antiderivative or indefinite integral of a function.

The integral of a function f(x) is denoted as ∫f(x) dx, and it represents the accumulation or the area under the curve of the function over a given interval. In other words, integration is the process of finding a function whose derivative is the given function.

The process of finding the integral of a function is called integration, and it is a crucial tool in many areas of mathematics, science, engineering, and economics.

Properties of Integrals:

1. Linearity:
   - The integral of a sum of functions is the sum of their integrals:
     ∫(f(x) + g(x)) dx = ∫f(x) dx + ∫g(x) dx
   - The integral of a constant multiple of a function is the constant multiple of the integral:
     ∫k f(x) dx = k ∫f(x) dx, where k is a constant.

2. Fundamental Theorem of Calculus:
   - The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus states that differentiation and integration are inverse operations. If a function F(x) is an antiderivative of a function f(x), then the integral of f(x) over an interval [a, b] is equal to the difference between the values of F(x) at the endpoints of the interval:
     ∫_a^b f(x) dx = F(b) - F(a)

3. Integration by Parts:
   - The integral of the product of two functions can be found using the integration by parts formula:
     ∫u dv = uv - ∫v du

4. Substitution:
   - The integral of a composite function can be found using the substitution method, where a new variable is introduced to simplify the integration process.

5. Trigonometric Integrals:
   - The integrals of basic trigonometric functions can be evaluated using various techniques, such as substitution, integration by parts, and trigonometric identities.

6. Exponential and Logarithmic Functions:
   - The integrals of exponential and logarithmic functions can be evaluated using the properties of these functions and the fundamental theorem ofegrals:
   - The indefinite integral of a function calculus.

Types of Integrals:
