4. Hexadecimal S
ystem (Base 16): The hexad
ecimal system by
 employs sixteen symbo
 ls (0-9 and A-F) for 
representation. Each hexa
decimal digit c
orresponds to a power of 16, with the rightmost digit represent
ing 16^0 (1),
 the next digit repres
 enting 16^1 (16), and so forth. Hexadecimal numbers are commonly used in computing for memory
 addressing, color encoding, and character representation.

Understanding dif
ferent number systems and their conversions is crucial for various applications, including data representation, arithmetic operations, and programming. Conv

erting numbers between systems involves translating values from one base to another using specific algorithms and techni
ques. Proficiency in number systems enhances problem-solving skills, computat
ional efficiency, and the ability tosymbols 
and rules used to express numerical values, with each system defined by a b
ase that determines the number of unique symbols used for representation.
 The most common number systems include the decimal system, binary system, octal s
ystem, and hexadecimal system, each with its own characteristics and applications.

1. Decimal System (Base 10): The decimal system is the m
ost familiar number system used in everyda
y life, consisting of ten symbols (0-9). Each digit's position in a decim
al number represents a power of 10, with the rightmo
st digit denoting units, the next digit denoting tens, and so on. Decimal numbers are used for counting, measurement, and financial transactions.

2. Binary System (Base 2): The binary system is fundame
ntal in computer science and digital electronics, using only two symbols (0 and 1). Each digit in a binary number represe
nts a power of 2, with the rightmost digit corresponding to 2^0 (1), the next digit to 2^1 (2), and so forth. Binary number
s are essential for representing data in computers and performing logical operations.

3. Octal System (Base 8): The octal system uses eight s
ymbols (0-7) to represent values. Each octal digit .</p>
